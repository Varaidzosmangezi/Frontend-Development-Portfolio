                        My name is Varaidzo Samantha Mangezi I am a 25 year old female electrical engineering graduate.
                        I love programming, I really enjoyed the software courses I did during my degree.
                        I desire to learn more about programming to purse a career in it. My long term goal involves 
                        working within the AI field in some capacity. I am ready to put in the necessary work to make it.

                <strong>Education</strong>
                <p>
                    I have a 2.1 degree qualification in Electrical Engineering from the University
                    of Zimbabwe. In this program I learnt Java, JavaScript, Python and C++ as well as MySQL DB. <br>
                    <br>
                    In addition to the information and practice I had at school as well as on freeCodeCamp and following along 
                    YouTube tutorials, I also completed the Brainnest Frontend development program. This program 
                    prepared me for the real world problems and how to structure and present solutions.

                <strong> Experience </strong>
                <p>
                    During the duration of the Brainnest training program I worked in groups to build various websites. This allowed 
                    me to resolve conflicts hands on. It also helped me learn to divide tasks among team members. Due to the different skill level 
                    of people in the course I also learnt a lot about their programming style and the reasons behind their decisions. <br>
                    I built the calculator, rock paper scissors game and my Portfolio.
